## Desing system;
Our design system is fucking easy, 

    You have to use "component" for every component and
    You have to use "half-component" for every component child.

    For example:

    ```
            <div class="blah blah blah component">
                <button class="half-component">
                    Great design system, isn't?
                </button>
            </div>

            <div class="half-component">
                <div class="mt-6  md:mt-8">
                    // half of half component :)
                    <button>
                        let's fucking go.
                    </button>
                </div>
            </div>
    ```

    If you want to use it vertical, then just use "mx-4 md:mx-8".

As I said, our design system is fucking easy and fucking great.
